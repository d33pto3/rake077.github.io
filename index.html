            His fame rests on his striking depictions of exaggeratedly muscular Bangladeshi peasants engaged in the activities of their everyday lives.
            Sultan's early works were influenced by western technics and forms, particularly impressionism, however, in his later works particularly,
            works exhibited in 1976, we discover there is a constant temptation to decolonize his art technics and forms.
